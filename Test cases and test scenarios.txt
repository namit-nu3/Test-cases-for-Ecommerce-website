TEST CASE -
A Test Case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application. A Test Case contains test steps, test data, precondition, and postcondition developed for a specific test scenario to verify any requirement. The test case includes specific variables or conditions, using which a testing engineer can compare expected and actual results to determine whether a software product is functioning as per the requirements of the customer.

TEST SCENARIOS - 
Test Scenarios is a funtionalty that can be tested. it is a collective set of test cases which helps the testing team to deterine the positive and negative characterstics of the project.
Test Scenarios gives an high level idea of what we need to test.



Difference between test case and test scenarios

1. A test Case is a set of actions executed to verify particular features or functionality, whereas a Test Scenario is any functionality that can be tested.

2. Test Case is mostly derived from test scenarios, while Test Scenarios are derived from test artifacts like BRS and SRS.

3. Test Case helps in exhaustive testing of an application, whereas Test Scenario helps in an agile way of testing the end-to-end functionality.

4. Test Cases are focused on what to test and how to test, while Test Scenario is more focused on what to test.

5. Test Cases are low-level actions, whereas Test Scenarios are high-level actions.

6. Test Case requires more resources and time for test execution, while Test Scenario requires fewer resources and time for test execution.

7. Test Case includes test steps, data, and expected results for testing, whereas Test Scenario includes an end-to-end functionality to be tested.
